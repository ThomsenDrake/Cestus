Owned files:

- `scripts/resident-agent/assurance/task136-bounded-assurance.mjs`

Authorization:
- The approved Task136 V4 design and implementation plan explicitly authorize
  this task-scoped subagent-driven development and test-driven development
  sequence.
- This worker is the single production writer. Any reviewer is read-only.
- The user authorization requires the claim commit, causal RED commit, and
  GREEN commit to remain separate; no squash, amend, rebase, or reset is
  permitted.

Immutable inputs:
- `docs/agentic/contracts/task136-bounded-assurance-v1.json` SHA-256:
  `d33864d9964a355067b7be86c78951d3df184a80b80765da3f51aab66e903fed`
- `docs/agentic/contracts/task136-bounded-assurance-v2.json` SHA-256:
  `c23a390cc3e4a3395c018a8532e0fa84b23a880782805f7cbcc463d9e8162ba4`
- `docs/agentic/contracts/task136-bounded-assurance-v3.json` SHA-256:
  `8934dbaf8246d295eba5ce825169ac08bb98f0e1b6b75a977657000cb46a1bbb`
- The first ten raw `task136-dispatch-release.v4` fenced JSON records remain
  byte-for-byte immutable under the approved per-card SHA-256 pins.

Bounded scope:
- V4 changes only the hard-coded Task137A and Task129-MFA compatibility
  branches, transfers exactly four approved paths to Task137B-W, and leaves
  the registry unchanged.
- Repository admission must retain the ordered ten-record prefix and fail
  closed with `repository release closure incomplete: expected 29 records,
  found 10` until record 11 exists.
- No network, providers, credentials, external services, `neo`, push,
  registry edit, or full `npm run verify` is permitted.
