# Resident Agent Full-Vision Program Registry

This is the append-only coordination record for the resident-agent full-vision
program. A later entry supersedes a status without removing prior evidence.
The coordinator rejects any implementation dispatch whose entry lacks the exact
governing documents, task range, wave stop, ownership, model configuration, or
explicit implementation authorization.

## RV-0-A-001 — Task 100 control audit without authorization

- Recorded at: 2026-07-12T16:45:55Z
- Role: coordinator
- Lane and wave: A / 0 (program-control coordination record)

- Forbidden files: every production, test, runtime, UI, provider, shared-contract, and program-plan file
- Dependencies and required merged commits: none; Task 100 begins at the approved program-plan head c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379
- Approval record: no approval is recorded. This explicit negative-control field records the absence of authorization and is not an authorization message.
- Claim status: ready-for-review
- RED command and observed failure: npm run factory:check; git diff --check / both commands exited 0, and the control audit correctly failed dispatch validation because this entry intentionally contains no authorization message
- GREEN command and observed result: npm run factory:check and git diff --check exited 0; npm run verify exited 0 after pinned dependencies were restored with npm ci
- Full verification: npm run verify / exit 0: typecheck passed; 189 test files passed with 3 skipped; 2,228 tests passed with 5 skipped; Vite built with the existing chunk-size warning; factory-readiness passed
- Live-provider gate: not-applicable; Task 100 creates documentation controls only
- Review verdict: pending / fresh review has not started
- Rebase record: c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379 to c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379; no cross-lane command applies
- Merge readiness: not-ready
- Archive check: no final answer; worktree, ancestry, verification, and merge state await Task 100 completion
- Control audit: non-dispatchable because this entry intentionally contains no authorization message.
- Historical repair note: before RV-0-A-003, this audit omitted the mandatory Approval record field; RV-0-A-003 preserves the focused RED command and observed failure for that review finding.

- Approval record: source delegation recorded 2026-07-12; approved spec docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-resident-agent-full-vision-program-design.md@56bf62b4 and plan docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-resident-agent-full-vision-program-implementation.md@c68f4fce; allowed range Task 100 review-record repair only; wave stop repair commit and stop for separately model-pinned fresh re-review; no merge into neo
- Claim status: ready-for-review
- RED command and observed failure: the focused RV-0-A-001 mandatory-field audit exited 1 with `RED: RV-0-A-001 is missing mandatory field(s): Approval record`
- GREEN command and observed result: focused RV-0-A-001 mandatory-field audit passed with every mandatory field and an explicit non-authorizing Approval record; git diff --check exited 0 with no output; npm run factory:check exited 0 with factory-readiness passed
- Full verification: npm ci restored the absent pinned dependencies after the initial npm run verify reported `tsc: command not found`; the fresh npm run verify then exited 0: typecheck passed; 189 test files passed with 3 skipped; 2,228 tests passed with 5 skipped; Vite built with its existing chunk-size warning; factory-readiness passed
- Live-provider gate: not-applicable; Task 100 review-record repair changes documentation controls only
- Review verdict: needs-changes / coordinator-supplied Task 100 review verdict found the missing RV-0-A-001 Approval record and the absence of a superseding ready-for-review evidence record; fresh re-review is pending and must use a separately model-pinned reviewer
- Rebase record: 8a20fffde1a0ef48d2acbb91768806c91ebe63a7 to 8a20fffde1a0ef48d2acbb91768806c91ebe63a7; no cross-lane command applies
- Merge readiness: not-ready; this repair has no authority to merge into neo and must stop for fresh re-review
- Archive check: repair commit, clean worktree, ancestry, verification, fresh review verdict, and coordinator merge state remain required
- Supersession: this record supersedes RV-0-A-002 for Task 100 claim status, review context, and verification evidence; RV-0-A-001 remains the historical negative-control RED audit.
