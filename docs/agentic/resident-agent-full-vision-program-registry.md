# Resident Agent Full-Vision Program Registry

This is the append-only coordination record for the resident-agent full-vision
program. A later entry supersedes a status without removing prior evidence.
The coordinator rejects any implementation dispatch whose entry lacks the exact
governing documents, task range, wave stop, ownership, model configuration, or
explicit implementation authorization.

- Forbidden files: every production, test, runtime, UI, provider, shared-contract, and program-plan file
- Dependencies and required merged commits: none; Task 100 begins at the approved program-plan head c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379
- Claim status: ready-for-review
- RED command and observed failure: npm run factory:check; git diff --check / both commands exited 0, and the control audit correctly failed dispatch validation because this entry lacks an approval record
- GREEN command and observed result: npm run factory:check and git diff --check exited 0; npm run verify exited 0 after pinned dependencies were restored with npm ci
- Full verification: npm run verify / exit 0: typecheck passed; 189 test files passed with 3 skipped; 2,228 tests passed with 5 skipped; Vite built with the existing chunk-size warning; factory-readiness passed
- Live-provider gate: not-applicable; Task 100 creates documentation controls only
- Review verdict: pending / fresh review has not started
- Rebase record: c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379 to c68f4fce838a17b35cee762e9a2916d1b42da379; no cross-lane command applies
- Merge readiness: not-ready
- Archive check: no final answer; worktree, ancestry, verification, and merge state await Task 100 completion
- Control audit: non-dispatchable because this entry intentionally omits the mandatory approval record and authorization message.
